                    <p>Here you are: offline. Not connected to this global system used to share every type of information you could ever imagine in really short periods of time: The internet. The only thing bringing you back is just a simple button turning airplane mode on or off, a mouse-click bringing you back on the WiFi-Network you were connected to or just a cable you have to plug back in. But you lucky and curious individual of a species called “humans”, you decided to disconnect yourself from this big, worldwide network that cannot stand still and wait for you. You just wanted to see what you can find here.</p>

                    <h2>Let's talk about staying.</h2>
                    <p>It's not about falling down the deep rabbit hole just because you followed something you would never believe in. The more you think about the fact that it was your own decision, going offline without expecting anything, the more you face the situation that there's nothing important keeping you here. There isn't anything trying to tie you up and force you to exist in this isolated, hard to reach place. Nothing tries to prevent you from leaving. It was just you and your curiosity. You still can go back online any time you want but keep in mind: when you leave, you also lose access to all the fabulous words and images that exist only because you were brave enough trust me. They're only here as long as you stay.</p>

                    <h2>Why are we here?</h2>
                    <p>I hope you aren't upset because I am trying to make you stay here. It's not just because I am not good at letting people go. Imagine this place as a little oasis. An oasis far away from the life you spend scrolling through your timeline on Twitter or Instagram, far away from searching for something in lots of shops on the internet and far away from all the annoying ads on every website or mobile game app.</p>
                    <p>As long as you stay, nobody can reach you and nobody can be reached by you. No kind of messenger work in this place. Neither WhatsApp nor Telegram, Signal or threema or anything else you prefer. All files you share with other people via a cloud service are unreachable. You cannot continue streaming your favorite series anymore. Furthermore you have isolated yourself from any kind of entertaining content. You cannot search for YouTube videos or memes on Reddit anymore to kill some time. Sure, there are ways trying to bypass this kind of fence by downloading content and storing it using the fact that some recently accessed data is still available in some kind of cache to guarantee offline access but you should not distract yourself with any kind of entertainment while reading this text.</p>
                    <p>How do you feel right now? Sometimes it's scary to be so far away from the rest of the world. I mean, physically you are still alive but most of your social interactions and sources for deflection are blocked now until you leave from here. Hold on before you kill the spirit of this place. I understand that it might make you nervous. Every second you stay, some new message might arrive and you wouldn't even notice. Somebody might try to get your attention and you wouldn't even recognize. Someone might need your opinion and you couldn even help them. You wouldn't be able to watch any kind of live stream of a YouTuber or Twitch streamer right now. That kind of social pressure, forcing you to stay in contact the whole time and keep yourself up to date as frequently as possible can now not be satisfied anymore. Furthermore, you lost all access to these things we know as entertainment today. Doesn't that make you feel tense? Hopefully not. Ever thought about killing the pressure and occupying you with yourself?</p>

                    <h2>How about resting a bit?</h2>
                    <p>When was the last time you cut all connections to social media and treated yourself with a break? It doesn't have to be a long break. Just a couple of minutes where you lay down your smartphone, turn off your PCs and TVs and everything else so the only things running are just some clocks and the fridge at home? Are you willing to enjoy these moments? Hopefully. While the rest of the world is moving continuously, we all should realize that sometimes a break can be valuable.</p>
                    <p>And now, before you leave this place, please hold on for a minute and think about all the things that cannot disturb you anymore right now. Think about the time you regain when you don't have to wait for websites to load and messages to arrive. Think about the things you left undone because you were at a time-consuming, stressful place that claimed your attention for a long time. Think about the couple of minutes before you started reading this non-philosophic essay-like letter.</p>

                    <h2>Time to go?</h2>
                    <p>I cannot make you stay here forever because in some way you have to go back. Maybe somebody is waiting for your reply, maybe someone wants to talk to you or maybe you realized that you always wanted to do something but you never took the time to begin. I hope you realized that you can sometimes take a break, go offline and enjoy the silence and if you want you can come back here because this place is always pleased to see you.</p>
