                    <p>Here you are: offline. No way, that you are still connected to a global system, used to share every type of information you could ever imagine in really short time periods: The internet. The only thing that brings you back is just a simple button, turning airplane mode on or off, a mouse-click, bringing you back on the WiFi-Network you were connected to or just a cable you have to plug in againt. But you, lucky and curious individual of a species calld "humans", you decided to disconnect youself from this big, worldwide surrounding network that cannot stand still and wait for you, just to see what you can find here.</p>

                    <h2>Let's talk about staying.</h2>
                    <p>It's not about falling down the deep rabbit hole just because you followed something you would never belive in. The more you think about the fact that it was your own decision, going offline without expecting anything, the more you face the situation that there's nothing important keeping you here. There isn't anything trying to tie you up and force you to exist in this isolated, heavily reachable place. Nothing tries to prevent you from leaving. It was just you and your curiosity. You still can go back online every time you want but keep in mind: when you leave you also loose acess to all the fabulous words and images that exist only beacuse you were brave enough of trusting me. They're only here as long as you stay.</p>

                    <h2>Why are we here?</h2>
                    <p>I hope you aren't upset beacuse I am trying to make you stay here. It's not just because I am not good at letting people go. Imagine this place as a little oasis. An oasis far away from your live you spend scrolling through your timeline on Twitter or Instagram, far away from searching for something in lots of shops on the internet and far away from </p>
                    <p>As long as you stay, nobody can reach you and the other way around nobody can be reached by you. Any kind of messenger isn't working within this place. Neither WhatsApp or Telegram, Signal or threema or anything else you prefere. All files you share with other people via a cloud service are unreachable. You cannot continue streaming your favorite series any more. Forthermore you have isolated yourself from any kind of enterntaining content. You cannot search for YouTube videos or memes on Reddit any more to kill some time. Sure there are ways trying to bypass this kind of fenc by downloading content and store it using the fact that some recently acessed data is still available im any kind of cache to guarantee offline acess but you should not distract yourself from any kind of entertainment while reading this text.</p>
                    <p>How do you feel right now? Sometimes it's scarying to be so far away from the rest of the world. I mean, physically you are still alive but most of your social interactions and sources for deflection are blocked now until you leave from here. Hold on before you kill the spirit of this place. I understand that it might make you nervous. Every second you stay some new message might appear and you wonldn't even notice. Somebody might try to get your attention and you woldn't even recognize. Someone might need your opinion and you woldn't even help him or here. You wouldn't be able to watch any kind of live stream of a youtuber or Twitch streamer right now. That kind of social pressure, forcing you to stay in contact the whole time and keep yourself up to date as frequently as possible can now not be satisfied any more. Furthermore you lost all acess to these things we now as entertainment today. Doesn't that make you feel tense? Hoefully not. Ever thaught about killing the pressure and employ you with yourself?</p>

                    <h2>How about resting a bit?</h2>
                    <p>When was the last time you cut all connections to social media and treat yourself a break? It doesn't have to be a long break. Just a couple of minutes where you lay down you smartphone, turn off you PCs and TVs and everything else so the only things running at just some clocks and the fridge at home? Are you willing to enjoy these moments? Hopefully. While the rest of the world is moving continuosly, we all should realise that sometimes a break can be useful.</p>
                    <p>And now before you leave this place please hold on for a minute and think about all the things that cannot disturb you any more right now. Think about the time you harvest when you don't have to wait for websites to load and messages to arrive. Think about the things that you lie down behind you beacuse you were at a time-consuming, stressfull place that claimed your attention for a long time. Think about the couple of minutes before you started reading this non-philosophic essay-like letter.</p>

                    <h2>Time to go?</h2>
                    <p>I cannot make you stay here forever because somehow you have to go back. Maybe somebody is waiting for your reply, maybe someone wants to talk to you or maybe you realised that you alwasy wanted to do something but you never take the time to begin. I hope you realised that you can sometimes take a break, go offline and enjoy the silence and if you want you can come back here because this place is always please to see you.</p>
